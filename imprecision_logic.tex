\section*{Abstract}
\label{sec:org17d378b}
\begin{description}
\item[{Background}] The use of a simple but sensitive test to identify
samples that require additional investigation with a more complex
and informative method is a common paradigm in population screening
and laboratory medicine in general. A biomarkers distribution in the
tested population and analytical imprecision of the method can be
used to guide selection of screening thresholds.
\item[{Methods}] A simulation using newborn screening the population
distribution for galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase (GALT)
activity and analytical imprecision for the GALT assay were used to
estimate the number of samples that would required repeat analysis
and the number with possibly erroneous screening determinations due
to analytical imprecision.
\item[{Results}] In the case of GALT activity screening a conservative
initial threshold can essentially eliminate the chance of a false
negative screen due to analytical imprecision, the trade off is a
greater number of samples requiring follow-up testing.
\item[{Conclusion}] Selection of thresholds in a screening algorithm is
informed by estimates of the number of samples that require repeat
testing and the number that could be false negative due to
analytical imprecision.

\section*{Introduction}
\label{sec:orgd29a6d7}
Newborn screening commonly uses algorithms based on biomarkers
measured in dried blood spot samples to identify neonates with an
increased probability of a target disorder. These screening algorithms
generally involve two or more phases of testing. All samples are
tested in the initial phase and during this phase sensitivity is
emphasized over specificity to identify samples with higher
probability of disease for additional investigation. The confirmatory
phase of testings uses an approach that maintains high sensitivity
with improved specificity. Ideally an orthogonal analytical method or
a different biomarker(s) are employed in the confirmatory phase of
testing, however in a number of disorders the same assay is applied in
duplicate with a more specific confirmation threshold applied to the
mean of the three resulting biomarker measurements (Figure
\ref{fig:org99dddbf}). This approach improves the precision of the final
screening result, reducing the chance that a sample will be deemed
screen negative due to analytical imprecision.

Confirmatory threshold values used in newborn screening are set based
on the distribution of the biomarker: in the healthy population, the
affected population and specific sub-populations based on demographics
such as age, gestational age and birth weight. The goal of the
laboratory is to identify samples with abnormal biomarker results
relative to these confirmatory thresholds. When the same assay is used
in both the initial and confirmatory phases of screening the
imprecision of the assay at the confirmatory threshold is useful in
determining an appropriate initial threshold. The probability that a
laboratory will incorrectly assign a screen negative determination due
to analytical imprecision can be estimated from the probability of a
result near the initial threshold and the imprecision of the method at
the confirmation threshold. This approach will be illustrated for
newborn screening for classic galactosemia (\hyperlink{citeproc_bib_item_9}{Schweitzer 1995}).

In Ontario, Canada newborn screening for classic galactosemia is based
on measurement of galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase (GALT)
activity in dried blood spots (\hyperlink{citeproc_bib_item_1}{Beutler 1991}). All samples are
tested for GALT activity, this is repeated in duplicate for samples
with activity below the initial threshold (Figure \ref{fig:org99dddbf}). The
mean of the three results is then assessed against the confirmation
threshold to determine if the newborn is screen positive or negative
for classic galactosemia. The classic galactosemia screening process
will be used to demonstrate an approach for establishing initial
thresholds in a multi-stage testing algorithm based on biomarker
distribution in a population and analytical imprecision at the
confirmation threshold. While newborn screening is being used to
demonstrate this approach it is applicable to many testing scenarios
in which biomarker results in a grey zone must be identified for
further investigation.

\section*{Material and Methods}
\label{sec:orge3096fc}
\subsection*{GALT Activity Data}
\label{sec:orgd0a7c3b}
The laboratory information system was queried for all newborn
screening GALT activity results from the first phase of screening in
the period 2017-01-01 to 2018-12-31 (n = 285,875). This data was used
to determine the probability density function for GALT activity in the
population.

During the study period dried blood spot GALT activity was measured
on the SpotCheck Pro platform (Astoria Pacific, Oregon USA.). GALT
activity was reported in units per gram of hemoglobin (U/g Hb). 903
filter paper was used for dried blood spot sample collection (EBF,
South Carolina, USA).

\subsection*{{\bfseries\sffamily TODO} Assay Impression at Screening Threshold}
\label{sec:org096a609}
The standard deviation of the GALT activity assay at the confirmation
threshold (1.5 U/g Hg) was estimated based on six months of quality
control (QC) data for a QC material with mean GALT activity of 1.6 U/g
Hg (n = \textbf{How many data points in six months of QC data})

\subsection*{Simulation}
\label{sec:orgdc2b861}
The population distribution of GALT activity results and the
imprecision at the confirmatory threshold were used to estimate the
number of potentially false negative samples due measurement
imprecision near the confirmation threshold. Analytical imprecision at
the confirmation threshold was modelled using a standardized normal
distribution with mean (\(\mu\)) equal to the confirmation threshold, and
the standard deviation (\(\sigma\)) of quality control results near the
confirmation threshold. The probability that a measured GALT activity
result x could arise when the true value is equal to the confirmation
threshold can be determined from the height of the probability
distribution for analytical imprecision at x (Ye\textsubscript{x}). The distribution
of GALT activity in the population was used to determine the
probability of a GALT activity of x in the population. Similarly the
probability of GALT activity x in the population can be determined
from the height of this probability distribution at X (Yp\textsubscript{x}). The
joint probability (Ye\textsubscript{x} \(\cdot\) Yp\textsubscript{x}) of the above conditions provides
an estimate of probability of a false negative result do to analytical
imprecision for GALT result x. The joint probabilities were then
summed over a given range to determine the probability of a false
negative result do to analytical imprecision for a range of GALT
results (Equation \ref{eq:joint}).


\begin{equation}\label{eq:joint}
p = \sum_{x=a}^b Ye_x \cdot Yp_x \cdot dx
\end{equation}

A simulation was used to examine multiple initial screening thresholds
where each initial threshold (I) is the confirmation threshold (C)
plus k number of standard deviation, for k from 0 to 6 (Equation
\ref{eq:initial}). For each value of k the predicted annual number of
samples in grey zone between the confirm and initial threshold was
estimated by the area in this region of the probability density
function of GALT activity in the population using the numerical
integration (Equation \ref{eq:grey}). The number GALT results above
initial threshold and potentially affected by analytical imprecision
was estimated using the joint probabilities (Ye\textsubscript{x} \(\cdot\) Yp\textsubscript{x}) summed from
the initial threshold to 7 standard deviations from the confirmation
threshold (Equation \ref{eq:imprecision}).

\begin{equation}\label{eq:initial}
I = C + k\sigma 
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:grey}
\text{grey zone samples}  =  n \cdot \sum_{x=confirm}^{initial} Yp_x \cdot dx
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:imprecision}
\text{imprecision zone samples}  =  n \cdot \sum_{x=initial}^{7\sigma} Ye_x \cdot Yp_x \cdot dx
\end{equation}

\section*{Results}
\label{sec:org6d60e95}

Two considerations when determining the threshold value used in the
initial phase of a two step screening algorithm (Figure \ref{fig:org99dddbf})
are the number of samples that would require repeat testing and the
potential for a false negative result during the first phase of
testing.  The "grey zone" is the region between the initial and
confirmation thresholds and all samples with GALT activity in this
range are repeated in duplicate in the second phase of screening
(Figure \ref{fig:org99dddbf} and \ref{fig:org3dd609b}). The "imprecision zone" is
the region outside the "grey zone" but within the distribution of
analytical imprecision at the confirmation threshold (7\(\sigma\) above
the confirmation threshold) (Figure \ref{fig:org3dd609b}, gold area). The
probability that the result is falsely negative do to analytical
imprecision is determined by the analytical imprecision at the
confirmation threshold and how far the result is from the confirmation
threshold.

A simulation was run to determine the number of samples that would
fall in the "grey zone" and in the "imprecision zone" as a function of
the GALT activity threshold used in the initial phase of screening
(Table \ref{tab:imprecision}). There is a trade-off between the number
of samples that require repeat testing and the number that could be
false negative due to analytical imprecision. Table
\ref{tab:imprecision} shows the estimated number of samples in the
"grey-zone" and "imprecision zone" annually for a set of initial
thresholds. For example, an initial threshold 1 standard deviation
from the confirmation threshold (GALT acitivty = 1.70 U/g Hb) would
result in \(\sim\) 10 samples in the grey zone (Figure \ref{fig:org3dd609b}
grey region) annually with \(\sim\) 15 samples in the "imprecision zone"
(Figure \ref{fig:org3dd609b}, gold region). In contrast an initial
threshold 6 standard deviations from the confirmation threshold (GALT
activity = 2.70 U/g Hb) from would result in \(\sim\) 222 samples in the
grey zone annually with essentially zero samples in the "imprecision
zone".

Samples below the initial threshold (grey and black regions) are reflexed for future testing.}

\section*{Discussion}
\label{sec:org77dc31d}

We have used a newborn screening algorithm for classic galactosemia to
demonstrate how data on analytical imprecision and biomarker
distribution in a population and can inform decisions on screening
thresholds. The ideas discussed here are second nature to the clinical
laboratory professional; there is analytical imprecision in all
laboratory results and results at the extremes of the population
distribution are rare. The utility of this approach is in combining
analytical and population information to get an estimate of the number
of possible false negative results and the number of samples sent for
confirmatory testing for a given threshold value, this could be a
screening threshold or a diagnostic threshold. These estimates could
be used to decided on appropriate initial phase thresholds and plan
for the number of samples expected to require more expensive and
labour intensive confirmatory testing.In newborn screening the
tolerance for a false negative first tier screening result is very
low, therefore, the most appropriate expansion factor should be
applied to avoid this possibility. There is also a cost involved in
repeat testing and the possibility that there is not adequate sample
which would prompt recollection.

While a newborn screening scenario was used to demonstrate this
approach it is applicable to any area of laboratory medicine where a
sensitive test is used to identify samples that require additional
investigation with a more complex and informative method. Examples
from other areas of laboratory medicine include but are by no means
limited to confirmation of hepatitis B serology results with a
antibody neutralization assay, spectrophotometric measurement of total
urine porphyrins to identify samples that require chromatographic
fractionation of urine porphyrins, confirmation of low point of care
glucose results by the central laboratory (\hyperlink{citeproc_bib_item_2}{Chen and Kaplan 2006}; \hyperlink{citeproc_bib_item_4}{Deacon 2001}; \hyperlink{citeproc_bib_item_6}{Lum 1996}).

The approach outlined here has focused exclusively on the impact of
method precision on a two phase testing process. Analytical bias and
pre-analytical factors are two categories of error that have not been
incorporated into the estimate of error at a threshold value however
this approach could be extended to incorporate total uncertainty of
measurement (\hyperlink{citeproc_bib_item_11}{White and Farrance 2004}).

\section*{{\bfseries\sffamily STARTED} Introduction}
\label{sec:org15a9216}

Newborn screening commonly uses algorithms based on biomarkers
measured in dried blood spot samples to identify neonates with an
increased probability of a target disorder. These screening algorithms
generally involve two or more phases of testing. All samples are
tested in the initial phase and during this phase sensitivity is
emphasized over specificity to identify samples with higher
probability of disease for additional investigation. The confirmatory
phase of testings uses an approach that maintains high sensitivity
with improved specificity. Ideally an orthogonal analytical method or
a different biomarker(s) are employed in the confirmatory phase of
testing, however in a number of disorders the same assay is applied in
duplicate with a more specific confirmation threshold applied to the
mean of the three resulting biomarker measurements (Figure
\ref{fig:org07cdf97}). This approach improves the precision of the final
screening result, reducing the chance that a sample will be deemed
screen negative due to analytical imprecision.

Threshold values used in newborn screening are set based on the
distribution of the biomarker: in the healthy population, the affected
population and specific sub-populations based on demographics such as
age, gestational age and birth weight. The goal of the laboratory is
to identify samples with abnormal biomarker results relative to these
screening thresholds. When the same assay is used in both the initial
and confirmatory phases of screening the imprecision of the assay at
the confirmatory threshold is useful in determining an appropriate
initial threshold (Figure \ref{fig:org07cdf97}). The probability that a
laboratory will incorrectly assign a screen negative determination due
to analytical imprecision can be estimated from the probability of a
result near the threshold the imprecision of the method at the
screening threshold. This approach will be illustrated using the
example of newborn screening for classic galactosemia (\hyperlink{citeproc_bib_item_9}{Schweitzer 1995}).

In Ontario, Canada newborn screening for classic galactosemia is based
on measurement of galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase (GALT)
activity in dried blood spots (\hyperlink{citeproc_bib_item_1}{Beutler 1991}). All samples are
tested for GALT activity, this is repeated in duplicate for all
samples with activity below the initial threshold. The mean of the
three results is then assessed againset the confirmation threshold to
determine if the newborn is screen positive or negative for classic
galactosemia. The classic galactosemia screening process will be used
to demonstrate an approach for establishing initial thresholds in a
multi-stage testing algorithm based on biomarker distribution in a
population and analytical imprecision at the confirmation
threshold. While newborn screening is being used to demonstrate this
approach it is applicable to many testing scenarios in which biomarker
results in a grey zone must be identified for further investigation.

\section*{{\bfseries\sffamily STARTED} Material and Methods}
\label{sec:org2cd0086}
\subsection*{GALT Activity Data}
\label{sec:org82f5671}
The laboratory information system was queried for all newborn
screening GALT activity results from the first phase of screening in
the period 2017-01-01 to 2018-12-31 (n = 285,875). This data was used
to determine the probability density function for GALT activity in the
population.

During the study period dried blood spot GALT activity was measured
on the SpotCheck Pro platform (Astoria Pacific, Oregon USA.). GALT
activity was reported in units per gram of hemoglobin (U/g Hb). 903
filter paper was used for dried blood spot sample collection (EBF,
South Carolina, USA).

\subsection*{Assay Impression at Screening Threshold}
\label{sec:org5beb283}
The standard deviation of the GALT activity assay at the confirmation
threshold (1.5 U/g Hg) was determined based on six months of quality
control (QC) data for a QC material with mean GALT activity of 1.6 U/g
Hg.  \textbf{How many data points in six months of QC data}

\subsection*{Simulation}
\label{sec:orgd0ff531}
The distribution of GALT activity results and the imprecision at the
screening threshold were used to estimate the number of samples
potentially affected by measurement imprecision near the screening
threshold. Analytical imprecision at the screening threshold was
modelled using a standardized normal distribution with mean (\(\mu\))
equal to the confirmation threshold, and the standard deviation
(\(\sigma\)) of quality control results at the screening threshold
(Equation \ref{eq:error}) The probability that a measured GALT
activity result X could arise when the true value is at the
confirmation threshold can be determined from the height (Ye) of the
probability distribution at X (Ye\textsubscript{x}). The distribution of GALT
activity in the population was used to determine the probability of a
GALT activity of X in the population. Similarly the probability of
GALT activity X in the population can be determined from the height
(Yp) of this probability distribution at X (Yp\textsubscript{x}). The joint
probability (Ye \(\cdot\) Yp) of the above conditions provides an estimate
of probability of a false negative result do to analytical imprecision
for GALT result X. The joint probabilities were then summed over a
given range to determine the probability of a false negative result do
to analytical imprecision for a range of GALT results (Equation
\ref{eq:joint}).


\begin{equation}\label{eq:joint}
p = \sum_{x=a}^b Ye_x \cdot Yp_x \cdot dx
\end{equation}

A simulation was used to examine multiple initial screening thresholds
where each initial threshold (I) is the confirmation threshold (C)
plus K number of standard deviation for K from 0 to 6 (Equation
\ref{eq:initial}). For each value of K the predicted annual number of
samples in grey zone between the confirm and initial threshold was
estimated by the area in this region of the probability density
function of GALT activity in the population using the numerical
integration (Equation \ref{eq:grey}). The number GALT results above
initial threshold and potentially affected by analytical imprecision
was estimated using the same approach for the joint probabilities (Ye
\(\cdot\) Yp) discussed above (Equation \ref{eq:imprecision}).

\begin{equation}\label{eq:initial}
I = C + K\sigma 
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:grey}
\text{grey zone samples}  =  n \cdot \sum_{x=confirm}^{initial} Yp_x \cdot dx
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:imprecision}
\text{imprecision zone samples}  =  n \cdot \sum_{x=initial}^b Ye_x \cdot Yp_x \cdot dx
\end{equation}

imprecision resulting value X when the true value is the confirmation
the area under the probability density function of measurement error
after scaling for the probability of a result at the confirmation
threshold in the population (Equation \ref{eq:scaled}). For each
value of K used to set an initial threshold (Equation
\ref{eq:initial}) the number of samples predicted to be affected by
measurement imprecision and not included in the grey zone was
determined.

\section*{{\bfseries\sffamily STARTED} Results}
\label{sec:org94abdc8}

Two considerations when determining the threshold value used in the
initial phase of a two step screening algorithm (Figure \ref{fig:org07cdf97})
are the number of samples that would require repeat testing and the
potential for a false negative result during the first phase of
testing.  The "grey zone" is the region between the initial and
confirmation thresholds and all samples with GALT activity in this
range are repeated in duplicate in the second phase of screening
(Figure \ref{fig:org07cdf97} and \ref{fig:orgb9fc8fd}). The "imprecision zone" is
the region outside the "grey zone" but within the distribution of
analytical imprecision at the screening threshold (Figure
\ref{fig:orgb9fc8fd}, gold area). All GALT results above the initial
threshold are potentially false negative however the probability that
the result is falsely negative do to analytical imprecision is
determined by the analytical imprecision at the confirmation threshold
and how far the result is from the confirmation threshold.

A simulation was run to determine the number of samples that would
fall in the "grey zone" and require repeat testing and those that in
the "imprecision zone" as a function of the GALT activity threshold
used in the initial phase of screening (Table
\ref{tab:imprecision}). There is a trade-off between the number of
samples that require repeat testing and the number that could be false
negative due to analytical imprecision. In newborn screening the
tolerance for a false negative first tier screening result is very
low, therefore, the most appropriate expansion factor should be
applied to avoid this possibility. There is also a cost involved in
repeat testing and the possibility that there is not adequate sample
which would prompt recollection. Table \ref{tab:imprecision} shows the
estimated number of samples in the "grey-zone" and "imprecsion zone"
annually for a set of initial thresholds. For example, an initial
threshold 1 standard deviation from the confirmation threshold (GALT
acitivty = 1.70 U/g Hb) would result in \(\sim\) 10 samples in the grey
zone (Figure \ref{fig:orgb9fc8fd} grey region) annually with \(\sim\) 15
samples in the "imprecision zone" (Figure \ref{fig:orgb9fc8fd}, red
region). In contrast an initial threshold 6 standard deviations the
confirmation threshold (GALT acitivty = 2.70 U/g Hb) from would result
in \(\sim\) 222 samples in the grey zone annually with close to zero samples in the
"imprecision zone".

\section*{{\bfseries\sffamily STARTED} Discussion}
\label{sec:orge62acb5}

We have used a newborn screening algorithm for galactosemia to
demonstrate how data on analytical imprecision and biomarker
distribution in a population and can be inform decisions on screening
thresholds. The ideas discussed here are second nature to the clinical
laboratory professional; there is analytical imprecision in all
laboratory results and results at the extremes of the population
distribution are rare. The utility of this approach is in combining
analytical and population information to get an estimate of the number
of false negative results and the number of samples sent for
confirmatory testing for threshold value, this could be a screening
threshold or a diagnostic threshold. These estimates could be used to
decided on appropriate initial phase thresholds and plan for the
number of samples expected to require more expensive and labour
intensive confirmatory testing.

While a newborn screening scenario was used to demonstrate this
approach it is applicable to any area of laboratory medicine where a
sensitive test is used to identify samples that require additional
investigation with a more complex and informative method. Examples
from other areas of laboratory medicine include but are by no means
limited to confirmation of hepatitis B serology results,
spectrophotometric measurement of total urine porphyrins to identify
samples that require chromatographic fractionation of urine
porphyrins, confirmation of low point of care glucose results by the
central laboratory (\hyperlink{citeproc_bib_item_2}{Chen and Kaplan 2006}; \hyperlink{citeproc_bib_item_4}{Deacon 2001}; \hyperlink{citeproc_bib_item_6}{Lum 1996}).

The approach outlined here has focused exclusively on the impact of
method precision on a two phase testing process. Analytical bias and
pre-analytical factors are two categories of error that have not been
incorporated into the estimate of error at a threshold value however
this approach could be extended to incorporate total uncertainty of
measurement (\hyperlink{citeproc_bib_item_11}{White and Farrance 2004}).

abstract = {Galactose is normally metabolized to glucose through the coordinated activities of three enzymes: galactokinase, galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase (GALT), and uridine diphosphoglucose 4-epimerase (epimerase). High concentrations of galactose and their metabolites are toxic to mammals. Hereditary deficiencies of galactokinase and of GALT and perhaps rarely of epimerase cause clinical disorders that can be prevented by early recognition and institution of a galactose-free diet. The genetics of disorders of galactose metabolisms and the methods used currently for their detection are reviewed. Future prospects in the diagnosis of these disorders are discussed. {\textcopyright} 1991 The Canadian Society of Clinical Chemists.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Newborn-screening false-positive rates (FPRs) are disproportionately increased in preterm infants. The objective of this study was to determine variation in newborn screening FPRs according to birth weight and gestational age. Our secondary objective was to examine the effect of postnatal age on FPRs in preterm infants. METHODS: The Ohio State Newborn Screening Program Database was analyzed to determine the overall and birth weight-specific FPRs for 18 analytes. Data were stratified into birth weight categories (4000 g). In addition, to examine the effect of postnatal age on FPRs, we examined the 2 analytes with the highest FPRs, thyrotropin with back-up thyroxine and 17-hydroxyprogesterone, in infants whose gestational age was <32 weeks, determined on the basis of postnatal age at screening. RESULTS: Data from 448 766 neonates were reviewed. Infants with very low birth weight (VLBW) comprised 1.9% of the study cohort, but accounted for 18% of false-positive results. For 14 of 18 analytes studied, FPRs increased with decreasing birth weight/gestational age and were significantly increased in infants with VLBW compared with infants who weighed 2500 to 3999 g (P < .001). Thyrotropin/back-up thyroxine and 17-hydroxyprogesterone accounted for 62% of total false-positive results in VLBW infants. When blood specimens were collected at a postnatal age of 48 hours in infants born at <32 weeks, a 44% relative reduction in 17-hydroxyprogesterone false-positive results was detected. CONCLUSIONS: False-positive newborn-screening rates are disproportionately increased in VLBW infants. FPRs may be reduced by delaying screening of <32 weeks' gestation, preterm infants until 24 to 48 hours' postnatal age. Pediatrics 2010;126:910-916},

abstract = {A critical limit protocol requiring that all point of care glucose meter readings > 22.2 mmol/L (400 mg/dL) and <2.2 mmol/L (40 mg/dL) be immediately confirmed by the laboratory was assessed. A total of 193 (2%) of 9,523 glucose meter determinations (63 patients) were >22.2 or <2.2 mmol/L. One hundred twenty-two (63%) of critically high and low glucose readings were followed up, and 71 (37%) results were not. Seventy-seven percent (55 of 71) of results without follow up were in patients with multiple glucose meter/central lab comparisons, suggesting that users may have thought it unnecessary to confirm such results. Split sample quality control specimens showed good correlation (r = 0.927) between glucose meter and central lab results, whereas correlation for follow-up glucose results was poorer (r = 0.793), perhaps reflecting time delay in obtaining a lab sample. For follow- up results, only 18% of high/low critical limit glucose meter readings were confirmed by drawing a lab specimen within 10 minutes. Fifty-eight percent were in 17 patients with multiple previous glucose meter readings, suggesting that users may have thought it less urgent to confirm a sequence of such results. Eleven follow-up results (9%) showed a >50% discordance between glucose meter/central lab with three (27%) glucose meter errors, emphasizing the need to confirm critically high/low glucose meter results to avoid potential errors. The critical limit protocol now requires that only the initial critically high/low glucose meter reading be confirmed by t he lab and that these patients now be followed with lab values until glucose levels are between 5.6-16.7 mmol/L (100-300 mg/dL) before the glucose meter can again be used.},

@article{Chen2006,
abstract = {Background: The usual criteria for analysis of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) are detection of HBsAg and result confirmation by antibody neutralization. We observed that with the Immulite 2000 HBsAg assay [Diagnostics Product Corporation (DPC)] a relatively high percentage of weakly reactive (WR) samples did not pass the neutralization step. Methods: For each of 3 lots of Immulite 2000 HBsAg reagent (DPC), we collected and analyzed HBsAg data from -3000 to 4000 patient blood samples and compared these data with HBsAg data from 3393 samples tested with the Abbott Auszyme assay. For 127 samples with initially WR detection signals (relative signal/cutoff index of 1.00-2.5) on the Immulite 2000 HBsAg assay, we then measured hepatitis B (HB) viral load and/or other HB serologic markers. Results: The Immulite 2000 HBsAg assay produced more initially reactive results than the Abbott Auszyme method. Many of these reactive samples, however, were WR and did not meet the confirmation criteria in the neutralization test. Moreover, DNA PCR testing indicated that 22 of the 38 WR samples (58%) that did meet the confirmation criteria had no detectable HB viral DNA. Conclusions: Immulite 2000 HBsAg assay results include a unique group of WR samples that are associated with both false-positive and false-negative results, regardless of neutralization status, and require careful interpretation. WR HBsAg samples should be reported as confirmed HBsAg reactive only if the samples not only meet the neutralization criteria but also are positive for other HB serologic markers such as anti-HB core total and anti-HB core IgM. {\textcopyright} 2006 American Association for Clinical Chemistry.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES This study examined for the first time to our knowledge the national data available from newborn screening programs in the United States and determined the salient characteristics of various screening tests for 3 hereditary metabolic disorders and 2 congenital endocrinopathies with emphasis on positive predictive values (PPVs) to delineate the magnitude of false-positive results. METHODS Reports published by the Council of Regional Networks for Genetic Services for 1990 through 1994 were examined carefully, paying particular attention to phenylketonuria, galactosemia, biotinidase deficiency, congenital hypothyroidism, and congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). Because of recent improvements in data collecting, reporting, and tabulating, we used data from 1993 and 1994 to determine the apparent sensitivity, specificity, relative incidence rates, and PPVs for the 5 disorders. For biotinidase deficiency and CAH, we also calculated relative incidence rates and PPVs for 1991 and 1992. RESULTS Our analyses revealed the following best estimates for the relative incidence rates of 5 disorders: phenylketonuria, 1:14,000; galactosemia, 1:59,000; biotinidase deficiency, 1:80,000; congenital hypothyroidism, 1:3,300; and CAH, 1:20,000. An apparent sensitivity of 100% has been reported by the various states for most of the disorders, and specificity levels are all above 99%. The PPVs, however, range from 0.5% to 6.0%. Consequently, on average, there are more than 50 false-positive results for every true-positive result identified through newborn screening in the United States. CONCLUSIONS The magnitude of false-positive results generated in newborn screening programs, particularly for congenital endocrinopathies, presents a great challenge for future improvement of this important public health program. Attention must be given to improved laboratory tests, use of more specific markers, and better risk communication for families of patients with false-positive test results.},

@article{Karaceper2016,
abstract = {Background: There is no consensus in the literature regarding the impact of false positive newborn screening results on early health care utilization patterns. We evaluated the impact of false positive newborn screening results for medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MCADD) in a cohort of Ontario infants. Methods: The cohort included all children who received newborn screening in Ontario between April 1, 2006 and March 31, 2010. Newborn screening and diagnostic confirmation results were linked to province-wide health care administrative datasets covering physician visits, emergency department visits, and inpatient hospitalizations, to determine health service utilization from April 1, 2006 through March 31, 2012. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were used to compare those with false positive results for MCADD to those with negative newborn screening results, stratified by age at service use. Results: We identified 43 infants with a false positive newborn screening result for MCADD during the study period. These infants experienced significantly higher rates of physician visits (IRR: 1.42) and hospitalizations (IRR: 2.32) in the first year of life relative to a screen negative cohort in adjusted analyses. Differences in health services use were not observed after the first year of life. Conclusions: The higher use of some health services among false positive infants during the first year of life may be explained by a psychosocial impact of false positive results on parental perceptions of infant health, and/or by differences in underlying health status. Understanding the impact of false positive newborn screening results can help to inform newborn screening programs in designing support and education for families. This is particularly important as additional disorders are added to expanded screening panels, yielding important clinical benefits for affected children but also a higher frequency of false positive findings.},

@article{Brockow2019,
abstract = {In Germany, screening for cystic fibrosis (CF) is part of the newborn screening since September 2016. The risk of psychological harm due to false-positive screening results is a longstanding concern. We investigated the parents' perception of the CF screening process in Bavaria and the communication after positive screening results with a questionnaire. Until August 2018, 192 children went through a final diagnostic testing after a positive CF screening result, and 105 (54.7%) families completed the questionnaire. Of these, only 30 parents obtained information about the newborn screening by a physician, despite this being mandatory in Germany. Parents being informed by a CF specialist (28.6%) about the positive screening result were more satisfied with the given information (80.0 versus 50% informed by the maternity ward), and the delay until the final diagnostic testing was shorter. More than 3 days between the information about the screening result and the diagnostic testing was too long for 77.7% of the families. Conclusion: Performing final diagnostic testing with only short delays and receiving satisfactory information is important. Therefore, parents should be informed directly by a CF center about positive screening results and only when sweat testing is possible within the next days.What is Known:• The risk of psychological harm due to false-positive screening results is a longstanding concern.• Satisfactory information about the positive CF screening result seem to reduce the parental stress.What is New:• Parents being informed directly by a CF specialist were more satisfied with the given information and the delay until the final diagnostic testing was shorter.• Our data support the concept that parents should better be informed directly by a CF specialist about positive screening results and only when sweat testing is possible within the next days to reduce parental stress.},

abstract = {Objective: We aimed to measure separately the contributions of heat and humidity to changes in levels of 34 markers of inborn disorders in dried-blood-spot (DBS) samples. Design and methods: We stored paired sets of DBSs at 37. °C for predetermined intervals in low-humidity and high-humidity environments. Marker levels of all samples in each complete sample set were measured in a single analytic run. Results: During the 30 ± 5. day studies, galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase and biotinidase lost almost 65% of initial activities in low-humidity storage; most of the degradation in 27 other markers was attributable to adverse effects of high-humidity storage; seven markers in DBSs stored at high humidity lost more than 90% of initial levels by the end of the study and 4 of the 7 lost more than 50% of initial levels within the first week of storage. Conclusions: Minimizing both humidity and temperature in DBS transportation and storage environments is essential to maintaining sample integrity. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Canadian Society of Clinical Chemists.},

@article{Thibodeau1993,
abstract = {In the Commonwealth of Virginia, 299,420 newborns were screened for biotinidase deficiency and galactosemia during the years 1989-1991 using enzymatic assays for galactose-l-phosphate uridyl transferase activity and biotinidase activity on dried blood filter paper cards. Retrospectively, false-positive initial samples for galactosemia or biotinidase deficiency were identified, and monthly frequencies of false-positive results were determined. The false-positive rates for galactosemia and biotinidase deficiency screening decreased over the 3-year period and were significantly higher in galactosemia screening for each year examined P < 0.001). For galactosemia screening, monthly false-positive rates were highest during May through September, seasonal differences in false-positive rates were significant for each year evaluated (P < 0.001). and seasonal false-positive rates for the 3 years combined were highest during the summer and lowest during the winter. For biotinidase deficiency, differences in seasonal false-positive rates were significant in 1989 (P<0.001) and 1991 (P<0.01), and the highest seasonal false-positive rate for the 3 years combined occurred in the spring. Average monthly temperature and year of measurement were significant factors in galactosemia screening only (P< 0.0001) and accounted for much of the variance in false-positive rates (r2= 0.43). Approximately half of the infants with false-positive results for biotinidase deficiency were premature, significantly more than the incidence of prematurity in Virginia (7-8%) during the 3 years (P<0.001). Prematurity in false-positive galactosemia screens was not significantly different from expected rates. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

@article{Slaughter2010,
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Newborn-screening false-positive rates (FPRs) are disproportionately increased in preterm infants. The objective of this study was to determine variation in newborn screening FPRs according to birth weight and gestational age. Our secondary objective was to examine the effect of postnatal age on FPRs in preterm infants. METHODS: The Ohio State Newborn Screening Program Database was analyzed to determine the overall and birth weight-specific FPRs for 18 analytes. Data were stratified into birth weight categories (4000 g). In addition, to examine the effect of postnatal age on FPRs, we examined the 2 analytes with the highest FPRs, thyrotropin with back-up thyroxine and 17-hydroxyprogesterone, in infants whose gestational age was <32 weeks, determined on the basis of postnatal age at screening. RESULTS: Data from 448 766 neonates were reviewed. Infants with very low birth weight (VLBW) comprised 1.9% of the study cohort, but accounted for 18% of false-positive results. For 14 of 18 analytes studied, FPRs increased with decreasing birth weight/gestational age and were significantly increased in infants with VLBW compared with infants who weighed 2500 to 3999 g (P < .001). Thyrotropin/back-up thyroxine and 17-hydroxyprogesterone accounted for 62% of total false-positive results in VLBW infants. When blood specimens were collected at a postnatal age of 48 hours in infants born at <32 weeks, a 44% relative reduction in 17-hydroxyprogesterone false-positive results was detected. CONCLUSIONS: False-positive newborn-screening rates are disproportionately increased in VLBW infants. FPRs may be reduced by delaying screening of <32 weeks' gestation, preterm infants until 24 to 48 hours' postnatal age. Pediatrics 2010;126:910-916},
